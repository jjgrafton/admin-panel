# README

This is the result of a workshop to create an admin panel for a college, using postgresql, ActiveRecord, Rails and Devise. As of May 2018 this is the MVP version â€“ the focus was on understanding database theory and creating basic and reliable core functionality. More features and functionality will be added in future versions.
