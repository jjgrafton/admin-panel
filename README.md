# README

This full-stack app is the result of a workshop to create an admin panel for a college. It was built using HTML, SCSS, postgresql, ActiveRecord, Rails and Devise. 

Users are able to create, edit and delete entries for students, instructors, courses and cohorts, and all changes and new entries are updated in the database.

As of May 2018 this is the MVP version â€“ the focus was on understanding database theory and creating basic and reliable core functionality. More features and functionality will be added in future versions.
